### 4. Customize your instalation

By default it will take the same configuration of the PC where you are running the wizard, but if you want to change the options uncheck the box "Use the recommended restore point for this machine".

### 5. Create an ISO file

If you are prompted, make sure to choose that you want to create/download the ISO file.

### 6. Choose where to save your ISO

Since it is such a large file, you will have to wait a while for the download to finish. Once finished, you will have the ISO to create your virtual machine.
