In this exercise, you will install VirtualBox on your computer and use it to create a virtual machine with Windows 10. VirtualBox will be your lab throughout the course, where you will have virtual machines with different operating systems where you can experiment in a controlled environment without affecting your main machine.

The following steps in this exercise are:

1. VirtualBox installation
2. Windows download
3. Creation of the virtual machine
4. Verification of the installation
